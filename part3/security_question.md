Before looking on OWASP Top 10 i would first check the connections between different modules of the whole system. I would check the following.

- Connection between FastAPI back and database
- Connection between Web Front and Mobile App with API

I would make sure that:

- Access to database is protected using authentication and that ONLY the database administrator (one of the sw engineers) can directly access it and make modifications to it.
- Access to the API is protected by an authentication mechanism, for example, JSON web tokens. And that the corresponding users (clients, sw engineers, support employess and sales employeess) have only the permissions they should have.
- That the input received from the front and sent to back is processed to prevent any form of code injection, specially SQL injection.

After that i would look into OWASP Top 10 for year 2021 (as stated in the question). The list is the following:

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Miconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated components
7. Identification and Authentication failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery

For each one thats relevant i will check the following in the application, based on the description of each vulnerability as provided in owasp.org page:

1. Broken Access Control: Check that users have only the permissions they should have, check that that access to other users data is protected, meaning, the user can only access its data. Check that unauthenticated users cannot access any data from the Web Front, Mobile App, API or database.
2.  Cryptogtaphic Failures: Verify that the app uses secure algorithms for token generation and validation, and that they are not deprecated. Verify that data is transmitted encrypted and via a secure protocol (i.e. HTTPS).
3.  Injection: Check that every user input or URL is pre processed before sending a request to the API.
4.  Insecure Design: Check the app design and verify that secure design patterns are used. Make sure that test are deseigned and implemented to check critical points like authentication and access api and database.
5.  Security Misconfiguration: Check that error message the end user can receive do not contain critical information from the system. Disable unnecesarry or unused features. Make sure that security features used during access and authentication are properly setup.
6. Vulnerable and Outdated components: Verify that only components (i.e. dependencies from package managers like npm) are from trusted sources. Verify that all components have the latest security updates and there no critical vulnerabilities reported for used dependencies.
7. Identification and Authentication failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery
